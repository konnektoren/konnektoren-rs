The quality tree breaks down key quality goals of the *konnektoren.help* project, including performance, security, scalability, usability, maintainability, accessibility, and internationalization.

=== Quality Scenarios

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Quality Attribute |Scenario Description

|**Performance**
|95% of user interactions (e.g., opening a challenge, updating the leaderboard) complete within 1 second. WASM binaries load quickly even on low-bandwidth connections.

|**Security**
|All user data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. Digital certificates are verified using Ed25519 signatures. No sensitive data is stored server-side unless explicitly consented.

|**Scalability**
|The system supports at least 1,000 concurrent users and can handle traffic spikes without downtime or significant slowdowns.

|**Usability**
|Users can register, start challenges, and view leaderboards with minimal guidance. The UI is intuitive and consistent across devices and platforms.

|**Maintainability**
|New features or bug fixes can be added with minimal impact on existing functionality. The codebase is modular, well-documented, and covered by automated tests.

|**Accessibility**
|The platform meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Users with disabilities can navigate and use all features.

|**Internationalization**
|The UI and content support multiple languages. Users can switch languages seamlessly, and translations are accurate.

=== Detailed Quality Requirements

==== Performance

* WebAssembly (WASM) is used for near-native browser performance.
* Static assets are served via Cloudflare CDN to minimize latency.
* Core algorithms are profiled and optimized for efficiency.
* WASM binary size is kept low for fast initial load.
* Performance is monitored and tested across target browsers and devices.

==== Security

* All user data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 or equivalent.
* HTTPS is enforced for all communications.
* Digital certificates use Ed25519 signatures for authenticity.
* Minimal server-side data storage reduces attack surface.
* Regular security audits and dependency vulnerability scans (`cargo audit`) are performed.
* Privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA) is maintained.

==== Scalability

* Serverless architecture enables automatic scaling based on demand.
* Static content is hosted on GitHub Pages for high scalability.
* Leaderboard and backend services are containerized for horizontal scaling.
* Load testing is performed to validate scalability targets.

==== Usability

* Responsive web design ensures consistent experience across desktop and mobile.
* Gamification elements (points, badges, leaderboards) increase engagement.
* User flows are tested and refined based on feedback.
* UI components are reused and versioned for consistency.
* Onboarding and help features are available for new users.

==== Maintainability

* Codebase adheres to Rust's official style guide (`rustfmt`).
* Modular architecture enables isolated updates and feature additions.
* Comprehensive unit, integration, and BDD tests are maintained.
* Inline documentation for all public APIs; architectural docs in AsciiDoc.
* CI/CD pipelines enforce code quality and test coverage.

==== Accessibility

* All interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.
* Sufficient color contrast and scalable fonts are used.
* ARIA attributes and semantic HTML are implemented.
* Accessibility is tested with automated tools and real users.

==== Internationalization

* All UI text and content are translatable via i18n framework.
* Language switching is available in the UI.
* Translations are reviewed for accuracy and completeness.
* Unicode and RTL language support is included.
