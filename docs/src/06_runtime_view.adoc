== Runtime View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.

* **Step 4:** The local storage sends the profile and game state data back to the Core.
* **Step 5:** The Core sends the loaded data to the Yew frontend.
* **Step 6:** The Yew frontend displays the map with the available challenges to the User.
* **Step 7:** The User selects a challenge on the map.
* **Step 8:** The Yew frontend checks the challenge requirements with the Core.
* **Step 9:**
* If the challenge is locked, the Core sends an error response back to the Yew frontend, which then displays an error dialog indicating that the challenge is locked.
* If the challenge is unlocked, the Core sends the challenge info back to the Yew frontend, which displays a challenge info dialog to the User.
* **Step 10:** If the challenge is unlocked, the User can start the challenge, which redirects them to the challenge URL.

=== Verifiable Credential Issuance Scenario

This scenario describes the process of a user obtaining a verifiable credential (badge) after completing challenges.

[plantuml, vc-issuance-c4, png]
----
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

Person(user, "User", "A learner who completed challenges")

System_Boundary(konnektoren, "Konnektoren System") {
    Container(frontend, "Frontend", "Yew/WebAssembly", "Web interface")
    Container(core, "Core", "Rust", "Business logic")
}

System_Ext(vc_issuer, "vc.konnektoren.help", "Verifiable Credential Issuer")

Rel(user, frontend, "1. Completes challenges")
Rel(frontend, core, "2. Verifies completion")
Rel(core, frontend, "3. Confirms achievement")
Rel(frontend, vc_issuer, "4. Requests credential", "HTTPS")
Rel(vc_issuer, frontend, "5. Issues OpenBadgeCredential", "OpenID4VC")
Rel(frontend, user, "6. Displays QR code for credential")

@enduml
----

* **Step 1:** The User completes a set of challenges on the Konnektoren platform.
* **Step 2:** The Frontend communicates with the Core to verify the completion of challenges.
* **Step 3:** The Core confirms the achievement back to the Frontend.
* **Step 4:** The Frontend requests a credential from the vc.konnektoren.help issuer.
* **Step 5:** The vc.konnektoren.help issuer creates and issues an OpenBadgeCredential using the OpenID4VC protocol.
* **Step 6:** The Frontend displays a QR code to the User, which can be scanned with a self-sovereign identity wallet to receive the badge.

This simplified diagram illustrates the key steps in the verifiable credential issuance process, highlighting the interaction between the user, the Konnektoren system, and the external credential issuer.

=== Event and Command Handling Scenario

This scenario illustrates how the EventBus and CommandBus facilitate communication and action execution in the Konnektoren system.

[plantuml, event-command-scenario, png]
----
@startuml
participant "User Interface" as UI
participant "Game Logic" as Game
participant "EventBus" as EB
participant "CommandBus" as CB
participant "Challenge Module" as CM

UI -> CB : Publish(NextChallengeCommand)
CB -> Game : Execute(NextChallengeCommand)
Game -> CM : Load Next Challenge
CM --> Game : Challenge Loaded
Game -> EB : Publish(ChallengeLoadedEvent)
EB -> UI : Notify(ChallengeLoadedEvent)
UI -> User : Update Display
@enduml
----

1. The User Interface publishes a NextChallengeCommand to the CommandBus.
2. The CommandBus executes the command, which is handled by the Game Logic.
3. The Game Logic loads the next challenge from the Challenge Module.
4. Once the challenge is loaded, the Game Logic publishes a ChallengeLoadedEvent to the EventBus.
5. The EventBus notifies all subscribers, including the User Interface, about the new challenge.
6. The User Interface updates the display for the user.

This scenario demonstrates how the EventBus and CommandBus decouple different parts of the system, allowing for a more modular and maintainable architecture.
