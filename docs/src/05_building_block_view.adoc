|===

This detailed diagram provides a clearer picture of the internal structure of the `konnektoren-core` crate, showing the relationships between different modules and packages.

=== Level 2: Command Structure

The command structure in konnektoren-core is designed to handle various actions within the game. It consists of the following main components:

[plantuml, command-structure, png]
----
@startuml
package "commands" {
    interface CommandTrait {
        +execute(state: &mut GameState) -> Result<()>
    }
    enum Command {
        Game(GameCommand)
        Challenge(ChallengeCommand)
    }
    enum GameCommand {
        NextChallenge
        PreviousChallenge
    }
    enum ChallengeCommand {
        NextTask
        PreviousTask
        SolveOption(usize)
        Finish(Option<ChallengeResult>)
    }
    CommandTrait <|.. Command
    Command *-- GameCommand
    Command *-- ChallengeCommand
}
@enduml
----

- `CommandTrait`: Defines the basic behavior for all commands in the game.
- `Command`: An enum representing all possible commands, including both game-level and challenge-level commands.
- `GameCommand`: Enum for game-level commands like navigating between challenges.
- `ChallengeCommand`: Enum for challenge-level commands like navigating tasks or solving options.

This command structure allows for a unified interface to execute various actions within the game, providing flexibility and extensibility for future additions.

==== konnektoren-yew

Purpose/Responsibility::
The `konnektoren-yew` crate is responsible for providing a web-based user interface for the Konnektoren project using the Yew framework.

[plantuml, challenge-rating-system, png]
----
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

Person(user, "User", "A user of the Konnektoren system")

System_Boundary(konnektoren, "Konnektoren System") {
    Container(frontend, "Frontend", "Rust, Yew", "Provides the user interface for interacting with challenges and submitting ratings")
    Container(backend, "Backend API", "Rust, Axum", "Handles API requests and manages data")
    ContainerDb(database, "Database", "Redis", "Stores challenge data, user ratings, and reviews")
}

Rel(user, frontend, "Views challenges, submits ratings and reviews")
Rel(frontend, backend, "Sends ratings/reviews, requests average ratings", "HTTP/JSON")
Rel_Neighbor(backend, database, "Reads from and writes to")
Rel_Back(frontend, user, "Displays average ratings")
@enduml

=== Level 4: Data Model

The data model is a crucial part of the Konnektoren system, defining the structure and relationships of the core entities. Understanding this model is essential for developers working on the system and for maintaining data integrity across different components.

[plantuml, data-model, png]
----
@startuml
!define TABLE(name,desc) class name as "desc" << (T,#FFAAAA) >>
!define PK(x) <u>x</u>
!define FK(x) #x

TABLE(PlayerProfile, "PlayerProfile") {
  PK(id): String
  name: String
  xp: Xp
}

TABLE(Challenge, "Challenge") {
  PK(id): String
  challenge_type: ChallengeType
  challenge_config: ChallengeConfig
  challenge_result: ChallengeResult
}

TABLE(GamePath, "GamePath") {
  PK(id): String
  name: String
  challenges: Vec<ChallengeConfig>
  map: Option<Map>
}

TABLE(GameState, "GameState") {
  game: Game
  challenge: Challenge
  current_game_path: usize
  current_challenge_index: usize
  current_task_index: usize
}

TABLE(Session, "Session") {
  PK(id): String
  FK(player_profile_id): String
  FK(game_state_id): String
}

PlayerProfile "1" -- "1" Session
GameState "1" -- "1" Session
GamePath "1" *-- "many" Challenge
Challenge "1" *-- "1" ChallengeConfig
Challenge "1" *-- "1" ChallengeResult
@enduml
----

Key Entities:

* PlayerProfile: Represents a user's profile information, including their accumulated experience points (XP).
* Challenge: Encapsulates a single challenge, including its type, configuration, and result.
* GamePath: Represents a sequence of challenges that form a learning path.
* GameState: Tracks the current state of a player's game, including their position in a game path and current challenge.
* Session: Links a player profile to their current game state.

This data model supports the core functionality of the Konnektoren system, allowing for flexible challenge creation, user progress tracking, and game state management. The relationships between entities enable features like personalized learning paths and progress persistence across sessions.

=== Achievement System

The achievement system consists of the following components:

* Achievement Configuration: Stored in YAML format, defining various achievements and their conditions.
* Achievement Evaluator: Evaluates the user's progress against the achievement conditions.
* Game Statistics: Collects and provides statistics about the user's game progress.
* Achievement Display: Shows unlocked and locked achievements in the frontend.
