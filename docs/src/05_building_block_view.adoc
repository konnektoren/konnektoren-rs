    );

    profile
}
----

These hooks simplify data access and state management in components,
allowing for more concise and readable code when working with repository data.

=== Yew Managers

Managers in the Yew frontend are special components that handle state management and data loading for specific parts of the application. They typically use the Context API or custom hooks to provide data and functionality to their child components.

==== Types of Managers:

* **ProfilePointsManager:** This manager handles the loading and updating of the user's profile points. It fetches the profile data from the `ProfileRepository` and makes it available to child components through properties.

* **InboxManager:** This manager is responsible for loading and managing the user's inbox messages. It retrieves inbox data from a YAML file and the `InboxRepository`. It also provides functionality to mark messages as read and persist this state.

==== Benefits of using Managers:

* **Centralized State Management:**  Instead of scattering state management logic across multiple components, managers provide a single source of truth for specific data.

* **Improved Data Loading:** Managers can handle asynchronous data fetching from repositories or APIs, simplifying data loading in child components.

* **Code Reusability:**  Managers encapsulate common logic related to specific data or features, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.

* **Better Organization:** Using managers helps organize your Yew application and separate concerns, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.


=== Level 4: Data Model

The data model is a crucial part of the Konnektoren system, defining the structure and relationships of the core entities. Understanding this model is essential for developers working on the system and for maintaining data integrity across different components.

[plantuml, data-model, png]
----
@startuml
!define TABLE(name,desc) class name as "desc" << (T,#FFAAAA) >>
!define PK(x) <u>x</u>
!define FK(x) #x

TABLE(PlayerProfile, "PlayerProfile") {
  PK(id): String
  name: String
  xp: Xp
}

TABLE(Challenge, "Challenge") {
  PK(id): String
  challenge_type: ChallengeType
  challenge_config: ChallengeConfig
  challenge_result: ChallengeResult
}

TABLE(GamePath, "GamePath") {
  PK(id): String
  name: String
  challenges: Vec<ChallengeConfig>
  map: Option<Map>
}

TABLE(GameState, "GameState") {
  game: Game
  challenge: Challenge
  current_game_path: usize
  current_challenge_index: usize
  current_task_index: usize
}

TABLE(Session, "Session") {
  PK(id): String
  FK(player_profile_id): String
  FK(game_state_id): String
}

PlayerProfile "1" -- "1" Session
GameState "1" -- "1" Session
GamePath "1" *-- "many" Challenge
Challenge "1" *-- "1" ChallengeConfig
Challenge "1" *-- "1" ChallengeResult
@enduml
----

Key Entities:

* PlayerProfile: Represents a user's profile information, including their accumulated experience points (XP).
* Challenge: Encapsulates a single challenge, including its type, configuration, and result.
* GamePath: Represents a sequence of challenges that form a learning path.
* GameState: Tracks the current state of a player's game, including their position in a game path and current challenge.
* Session: Links a player profile to their current game state.

This data model supports the core functionality of the Konnektoren system, allowing for flexible challenge creation, user progress tracking, and game state management. The relationships between entities enable features like personalized learning paths and progress persistence across sessions.

=== Achievement System

The achievement system consists of the following components:

* Achievement Configuration: Stored in YAML format, defining various achievements and their conditions.
* Achievement Evaluator: Evaluates the user's progress against the achievement conditions.
* Game Statistics: Collects and provides statistics about the user's game progress.
* Achievement Display: Shows unlocked and locked achievements in the frontend.
