== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and the development team must consider.
These include

* underlying business goals,
* essential features,
* essential functional requirements,
* quality goals for the architecture, and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations.
****

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users, a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist, this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

Konnektoren is a web-based learning platform focused on improving the understanding and usage of German grammar through gamification.
It offers interactive challenges—ranging from multiple-choice questions to scenario-based tasks—targeted at both beginners and intermediate learners.

**Main objectives:**

* Make learning German grammar engaging and effective.
* Use gamification (points, levels, achievements) to motivate users and increase retention.
* Provide measurable progress and feedback to learners and educators.

**Core Features:**

* User profiles and progress tracking
* Interactive grammar challenges
* Visual progress maps
* Leaderboards and achievements
* Certificate and badge issuance (SSI-compatible)

**Key Use Cases:**
|===
| Use Case | Description
| Create Profile | User sets up a personal profile name.
| Participate in Challenges | User selects and completes grammar challenges.
| Track Progress | User views progress via maps, achievements, and statistics.
| Compete on Leaderboards | User compares performance with others.
| Claim Certificates/Badges | User receives digital credentials for achievements.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders.
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):
image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions.
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|===
| Quality Goal | Scenario | Priority
| Usability | Users can intuitively navigate, start challenges, and view progress without training. | High
| Reliability | The platform maintains >99.9% uptime and recovers quickly from failures. | High
| Scalability | The system supports 1,000+ concurrent users with no performance degradation. | Medium
| Performance | Challenge loading and user actions respond within 1 second in 95% of cases. | Medium
| Security | All user data is encrypted in transit and at rest; certificates use digital signatures. | High
| Maintainability | Modular codebase allows new features to be added with minimal impact. | Medium

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e., all persons, roles, or organizations that

* should know the architecture,
* have to be convinced of the architecture,
* have to work with the architecture or with code,
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work,
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development.

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
