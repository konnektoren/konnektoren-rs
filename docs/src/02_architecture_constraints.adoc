== Architecture Constraints

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decisions about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints, and
conventions (e.g., programming or versioning guidelines, documentation, or naming conventions).

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technical Constraints

[options="header",cols="2,5"]
|===
| Constraint | Explanation
| Programming Language | All core libraries and backend services must be implemented in Rust to ensure compatibility with the Yew frontend and WebAssembly (WASM) compilation. This enables high performance, safety, and code reuse across frontend and backend.
| Browser Compatibility | The application must support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to maximize accessibility for users.
| WebAssembly Support | The frontend must compile to WASM for efficient execution in browsers, leveraging Rust's WASM toolchain.
| Scalability | The system should use a serverless or cloud-native architecture to handle variable loads and minimize operational overhead.
| Backend Services | Backend APIs and services must be written in Rust and deployed on scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., Docker containers, serverless platforms).
| Third-Party Integrations | Integrations (e.g., payment gateways, analytics) must use secure, standards-compliant APIs and minimize vendor lock-in.
|===

=== Organizational and Political Constraints

[options="header",cols="2,5"]
|===
| Constraint | Explanation
| Data Privacy | All features must comply with GDPR and other relevant data protection laws, as the platform serves users in the EU and globally.
| Budget Limitations | The project operates with a limited budget, relying on free/open-source tools and voluntary contributions. Use of paid third-party services must be justified and kept minimal.
| Development Timeline | Development is ongoing and flexible, driven by contributors' availability and free time. There are no fixed deadlines, but continuous improvement is encouraged.
| Stakeholder Involvement | Feedback from educators, students, and other stakeholders should be regularly solicited and incorporated into the design and development process.
| Content Review | All educational content must be reviewed and approved by qualified language experts before publication.
|===

=== Conventions

[options="header",cols="2,5"]
|===
| Constraint | Explanation
| Code Style Guidelines | All Rust code must follow the official Rust style guide (`rustfmt`) to ensure consistency and readability across the codebase.
| Versioning Guidelines | Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is required for all releases to communicate changes and maintain compatibility.
| Documentation Standards | All public APIs and core modules must be documented using Rustdoc. Additional architectural documentation should be maintained in AsciiDoc format.
| Naming Conventions | Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, modules, and crates, following Rust community conventions and internal guidelines.
| Testing Guidelines | Automated tests (unit, integration, and BDD) must be written for all new features and bug fixes. Code coverage should be monitored and improved over time.
| Security Practices | Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities (`cargo audit`), follow secure coding practices, and conduct periodic security reviews.
| Continuous Integration | All code changes must pass CI checks, including formatting, linting, and tests, before merging.
