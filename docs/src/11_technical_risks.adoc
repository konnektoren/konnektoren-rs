|Risk/Technical Debt |Description and Mitigation

|**Client-Side Data Storage Risks**
|Storing most user data client-side (browser/local storage) risks data loss if users clear their browser, switch devices, or lose access.

*Mitigation*: Provide clear backup/export instructions. Offer optional encrypted server-side backups. Educate users about risks.

|**Client-Side Cryptography and Signature Verification**
|Improper implementation of client-side encryption or digital signatures can lead to data leaks, spoofed certificates, or compromised privacy.

*Mitigation*: Use audited, well-established cryptographic libraries. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing. Stay updated on cryptography best practices.

|**WebAssembly (WASM) Performance and Compatibility**
|Large WASM binaries or poor browser support can cause slow load times, especially on low-bandwidth connections or older devices.

*Mitigation*: Optimize binary size, use code splitting/lazy loading, and profile performance across target browsers. Provide fallback UI for unsupported environments.

|**Reliance on Third-Party Services**
|Downtime, API changes, or discontinued services (e.g., Cloudflare, payment gateways, analytics) can disrupt platform functionality.

*Mitigation*: Design for graceful degradation. Monitor service status. Maintain alternative providers or backup solutions for critical services.

|**Docker Container Security**
|Leaderboard and backend services running in Docker containers may be vulnerable if images are outdated, misconfigured, or run as root.

*Mitigation*: Use minimal, regularly updated images. Enforce non-root users. Scan containers for vulnerabilities. Apply security patches promptly.

|**Axum Framework Maturity**
|Axum, while promising, is newer and may lack mature documentation or community support compared to older Rust frameworks.

*Mitigation*: Track Axum releases and security advisories. Keep code modular to allow framework migration if needed. Engage with the Axum community.

|**Insufficient Backend Logging**
|Lack of backend logging limits visibility into production issues, making debugging and incident response difficult.

*Mitigation*: Implement privacy-compliant, selective logging for critical events. Use log aggregation tools for monitoring.

|**Multi-Environment Deployment Complexity**
|Managing development, staging, and production deployments can lead to configuration drift and inconsistent environments.

*Mitigation*: Use containerization (Docker) and Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to standardize deployments. Automate environment setup and configuration.

|**UI Component Reuse Technical Debt**
|Sharing UI components across web and Telegram apps can cause compatibility issues if core components change without proper versioning.

*Mitigation*: Maintain strict version control and documentation for shared components. Test compatibility before upgrades. Use semantic versioning.

|**Limited SSI Wallet and Library Support**
|SSI badge adoption depends on wallet and library support, which is currently limited and sometimes unstable.

*Mitigation*: Monitor SSI ecosystem for improvements. Provide fallback achievement display for users without SSI wallets. Contribute to open-source SSI projects.

|**Rust/WASM Toolchain Upgrades**
|Frequent updates to Rust, WASM, or related toolchains may introduce breaking changes or require refactoring.

*Mitigation*: Pin toolchain versions in CI. Test upgrades in staging before production. Monitor Rust/WASM release notes.

|**Accessibility and Internationalization Gaps**
|Rapid feature development may overlook accessibility (a11y) or internationalization (i18n), limiting usability for some users.

*Mitigation*: Include a11y and i18n checks in code reviews. Use automated tools to detect issues. Prioritize improvements based on user feedback.
