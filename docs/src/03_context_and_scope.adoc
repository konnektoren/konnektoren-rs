== Context and Scope

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the Konnektoren system, showing the main components and their interactions.
Users, educators, and content creators interact with the system via secure web protocols.
Cloudflare acts as a CDN and proxy, while GitHub Pages hosts the static frontend.
The core logic and leaderboard service run in containers, and external services handle credential issuance and payments.

=== Business Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.
Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

|===
| Communication Partner | Inputs to System | Outputs from System
| Users (Learners) | Registration data, challenge answers, feedback | Learning progress, achievements, certificates, feedback
| Content Creators | Educational content submissions, updates | Content publication status, feedback
| Payment Gateway | Payment confirmations | Access to premium features, receipts
| External Credential Issuer | Credential requests | Verifiable credentials (badges, certificates)
|===

**Explanation of external domain interfaces**

The system interfaces with individual users, educators, and content creators.
It receives registration details, challenge responses, content submissions, and payment confirmations.
Outputs include learning progress, achievements, certificates, analytics, and feedback.

=== Technical Context

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition, a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems, together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

| I/O | Channel | Protocol
| User registration data | Internet | HTTPS
| Grammar test answers | Internet | HTTPS
| Learning progress | Internet | HTTPS
| Detailed reports | Internet | HTTPS
|===

**Explanation of technical interfaces**

The technical architecture leverages modern web protocols to ensure secure and efficient data transmission. User data and responses are transmitted over HTTPS, ensuring privacy and security. Detailed reports and learning progress are also transmitted over HTTPS.
