== Testing Strategy

=== Overview

The Konnektoren project employs a multi-layered testing strategy to ensure reliability, correctness, security, and performance.
Testing is integrated into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline, covering everything from individual functions to full user journeys.

=== Levels of Testing

==== Unit Tests

* *Purpose*: Validate the correctness of individual functions, methods, and small components.
* *Tools*: Rust's built-in test framework (`cargo test`)
* *Location*: Inline `#[cfg(test)]` modules within source files.
* *Coverage*: Target >80% coverage for all core logic and business rules.
* *Best Practices*: Use descriptive test names, cover edge cases, and maintain fast execution.

==== Integration Tests

* *Purpose*: Verify interactions between modules, crates, and external interfaces.
* *Tools*: Rust's integration test framework (`cargo test` in `tests/` directory)
* *Location*: `tests/` directory in each crate.
* *Coverage*: Focus on workflows, API boundaries, and module interoperability.
* *Best Practices*: Use realistic data, mock dependencies where needed, and test error handling.

==== End-to-End (E2E) Tests

* *Purpose*: Simulate real user scenarios and validate system behavior from start to finish.
* *Tools*: Cucumber for Rust (`cucumber-rs`)
* *Location*: `konnektoren-tests` crate, under `tests/features`
* *Coverage*: Critical user journeys, business scenarios, and acceptance criteria.
* *Best Practices*: Write Gherkin feature files for clarity, keep scenarios maintainable, and automate regression checks.

=== Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD tests are implemented using Cucumber for Rust, serving as both executable documentation and functional validation.
Scenarios are written in Gherkin syntax to describe expected behavior in plain language.

Example feature file (`konnektoren-tests/tests/features/challenge.feature`):

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Challenge

  Scenario: Loading a default challenge from YAML
    Given default challenge is loaded
    Then it should be a MultipleChoice challenge named "Konnektoren"
    And it should have exactly 5 options
    And it should have at least 1 questions
----

=== Performance Testing

* *Tools*: Rust's `criterion` crate for micro-benchmarks and profiling.
* *Focus*: Challenge loading, solving, leaderboard updates, and core algorithms.
* *Frequency*: Benchmarks run in CI/CD for each release and major update.
* *Best Practices*: Track performance trends, set thresholds, and optimize bottlenecks.

=== Security Testing

* *Static Analysis*: Use `cargo audit` to detect vulnerable dependencies.
* *Fuzz Testing*: Employ `cargo fuzz` for critical parsing and input validation.
* *Manual Penetration Testing*: Conduct periodic security reviews of deployed systems.
* *Best Practices*: Integrate security checks into CI, respond quickly to advisories, and document findings.

=== Continuous Integration (CI)

* All tests (unit, integration, BDD, benchmarks) are executed in GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
* Code coverage is measured and reported (e.g., via `cargo tarpaulin` and Codecov).
* CI enforces code formatting (`rustfmt`), linting (`clippy`), and test pass status before merging.
* Automated notifications for failed builds or coverage drops.

=== Test Data Management

* Challenge test data is stored in YAML files under the `assets` directory.
* Integration and E2E tests use programmatically generated or fixture-based mock data.
* Sensitive or large datasets are anonymized and versioned for reproducibility.

=== Future Improvements

* Add property-based testing with the `proptest` crate for more robust unit and integration tests.
* Expand E2E coverage to include edge cases, error flows, and multi-user scenarios.
* Introduce load and stress testing to validate system behavior under high concurrency and traffic.
* Automate accessibility and internationalization checks as part of the test suite.

By following this comprehensive testing strategy, Konnektoren maintains high quality, reliability, and confidence in frequent releases and rapid iteration.
