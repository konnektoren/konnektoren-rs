== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Core Library and UI Components

The *konnektoren* project is built around a core library that contains the business logic. This library is decoupled from any specific user interface and can be reused across different applications. Additionally, reusable UI components are provided, making it easier to integrate and combine them in various applications such as web apps and Telegram apps.

[plantuml, core-library, svg]
....
@startuml core-library
package "Konnektoren Core" {
  class BusinessLogic {
    +processData()
    +verifyCertificate()
  }

  package "UI Components" {
    class UIComponent1
    class UIComponent2
    UIComponent1 -- BusinessLogic
    UIComponent2 -- BusinessLogic
  }
}

UIComponent1 <|-- WebApp
UIComponent2 <|-- TelegramApp

@enduml
....

The diagram above shows the relationship between the core library, UI components, and the two apps (Web and Telegram) using these components.

=== Command and Event Handling

The Konnektoren system uses a command and event handling pattern, implemented primarily through the GameController, to manage game state and user interactions.

[plantuml, command-event-pattern, png]
----
@startuml
component "GameController" as GC
component "CommandBus" as CB
component "EventBus" as EB
component "GameState" as GS

GC --> CB : publishes commands
CB --> GC : executes commands
GC --> EB : publishes events
GC --> GS : updates
@enduml
----

This pattern provides several benefits:
- Decouples components by using commands and events for communication
- Allows for easy extension of functionality by adding new command and event types
- Provides a clear flow of control and data in the system
- Facilitates testing by allowing commands and events to be easily mocked or verified

=== Web3-Oriented Architecture

The apps are designed with a web3-oriented architecture, minimizing server-side storage. User data, except for the leaderboard, is stored client-side to ensure privacy and security. The system also employs encryption and digital signatures to verify certificates and user data.

[plantuml, web3-architecture, svg]
....
@startuml
actor User
node "Client" {
  [Local Storage] <<client-side storage>>
  [App Logic]
}

node "Server" {
  [Leaderboard Database] <<Server-Side Storage>>
}

User --> [App Logic] : Interaction
[App Logic] --> [Local Storage] : Store user data
[App Logic] --> [Leaderboard Database] : Update leaderboard

@enduml
....

This architecture ensures minimal dependency on centralized servers, following web3 principles. Only essential data, like the leaderboard, is stored server-side, while user data remains in local storage.

=== Encryption and Signatures for Verification

To ensure data integrity and security, the system uses encryption and signatures to verify certificates. This is a key part of the system’s security, ensuring that data shared between users and the server is verified without relying on a central authority.

[plantuml, encryption-diagram, svg]
....
@startuml
actor User

node "Client" {
  [Encryption] <<Client-Side Operation>>
  [SignatureVerification] <<Client-Side Operation>>
}

node "Server" {
  [Certificate Authority] <<Server-Side Operation>>
}

User --> [Encryption] : Encrypt/Decrypt data
[Encryption] --> [SignatureVerification] : Sign/Verify certificates
[SignatureVerification] --> [Certificate Authority] : Verify signature

@enduml
....

Encryption and digital signatures are central to the system’s security model, ensuring that all certificates are securely verified and that data is protected at rest and in transit.

=== No Backend Logging and Analytics

To preserve privacy, the *konnektoren.help* system does not employ any backend logging. Google Analytics is used minimally to help improve the product while adhering to privacy standards.

'''

This documentation provides a clear description of the concepts that cross-cut multiple areas of the *konnektoren.help* project. By adhering to web3 principles, employing encryption, and focusing on a modular, reusable core, the system ensures security and flexibility in its design.

=== Achievement System

The achievement system in Konnektoren is designed to motivate users and recognize their progress in learning German grammar.

==== Overview

The achievement system works as follows:

1. Achievements are defined in a YAML configuration file.
2. As users complete challenges, their progress is recorded in the Challenge History.
3. The Achievement Evaluator regularly checks the user's progress against the achievement conditions.
4. Unlocked achievements are displayed in the frontend, providing visual feedback and motivation.

==== Components

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
actor User
database "Achievement\nConfiguration" as AC
database "Challenge\nHistory" as CH
component "Achievement\nEvaluator" as AE
component "Game\nStatistics" as GS
component "Frontend" as FE

User -> CH : completes challenges
CH -> GS : provides data
AC -> AE : defines achievements
GS -> AE : provides statistics
AE -> FE : updates unlocked achievements
FE -> User : displays achievements

@enduml
....

1. Achievement Configuration: A YAML file that defines achievements, their conditions, and metadata (name, description, icon).
2. Challenge History: Records the user's completed challenges and performance.
3. Game Statistics: Aggregates data from the Challenge History to provide meaningful statistics for achievement evaluation.
4. Achievement Evaluator: Processes the Achievement Configuration and Game Statistics to determine which achievements have been unlocked.
5. Frontend: Displays unlocked and locked achievements to the user.

==== Implementation

The achievement system is implemented using the following key components:

- `AchievementDefinition`: Represents an individual achievement with its metadata and condition.
- `AchievementEvaluator`: Evaluates achievements based on game statistics.
- `GameStatistics`: Provides methods to calculate various statistics from the Challenge History.

The frontend periodically requests updated achievement information and displays it to the user, providing immediate feedback on their progress and newly unlocked achievements.


=== Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) for Badges

The Konnektoren project incorporates Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles for issuing achievement badges. This approach aligns with our commitment to user empowerment and data privacy.

[plantuml, ssi-badge-concept, svg]
....
@startuml
actor User
component "Konnektoren Platform" as KP
component "vc.konnektoren.help" as VCI
component "SSI Wallet" as Wallet

User --> KP : Completes challenges
KP --> VCI : Requests badge issuance
VCI --> User : Issues Verifiable Credential
User --> Wallet : Stores badge
@enduml
....

We've implemented SSI for badges for several key reasons:

1. **User Control**: Users have full ownership and control over their achievement credentials, deciding when and with whom to share them.
2. **Portability**: Badges can be stored in any compatible SSI wallet, allowing users to carry their achievements across different platforms and contexts.
3. **Privacy**: The SSI approach minimizes the need for centralized storage of user achievements, enhancing privacy.
4. **Verifiability**: Third parties can easily verify the authenticity of badges without needing to contact Konnektoren directly.
5. **Interoperability**: By using standard formats like Verifiable Credentials and OpenBadges, we ensure our badges can be recognized and utilized in a broader ecosystem.

This feature represents a step towards a more decentralized, user-centric approach to managing educational and achievement credentials, aligning with broader trends in digital identity and credentialing.
